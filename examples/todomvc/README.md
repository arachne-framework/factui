# FactUI TodoMVC

This is a very small example app using the traditional TodoMVC demo. It uses plain FactUI in a very basic, straightforward way; real applications may desire to add some additional plumbing ]for things like update handling (rather than calling `transact!` directly from event handlers, for example.


## Running the TodoMVC Example

1. Clone the FactUI repository
2. Switch to the `examples/todomvc` subdirectory.
3. Run `lein figwheel`
4. Visit `http://localhost:3449/app.html`
